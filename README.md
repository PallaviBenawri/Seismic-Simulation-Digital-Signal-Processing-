Simulation of aftershock using a wavelet-based description of the time frequency characteristics of a class of earthquake accelerograms and proposes three-parameter models for the modulation of wavelet coefficient envelopes of different frequency bands.

This project considers a wavelet-based description of the timeâ€“frequency characteristics of a class of earthquake accelerograms.
It proposes a three-parameter model for the modulation of wavelet coefficient envelopes of different frequency bands.
Estimation of the modulation parameters is attempted through simple scaling models using seismological and site parameters and the data from 1999 Chi-Chi earthquake and its aftershocks.
